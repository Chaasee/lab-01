        <h2>The Biography</h2>
        <p>
            It all began in 2004 when I was made my debut into the population. Then I began my way through the school
            system, starting
            with pre-school, then elementary school, into high school, and now college. That brings us to this very
            moment as I am writing
            this biography.

            The schools that I attended were Shanty Bay Public School (SBPS) for elementary and Eastview Secondary School (ESS) for 
            high school. My elementary school was very small so the transition to high school was quite overwhelming. The transition from
            high school to college on the other hand, was rather seamless for me.

            In terms of my achievements, about 4 years ago I competed in a regional spelling bee and I managed to score second place. If I had 
            got first I would have made it to the nationals. In spite of that I was still very happy with how well I did considering it was my 
            first time in a spelling bee. In the months leading up to the event, I was practicing a list of 400 words that was provided and I had 
            learned every single word from the list. The funny thing is that I only ended up needing to use about 4 of them in the end but it's the 
            effort that counts.
